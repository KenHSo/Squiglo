# Squiglo

A minimal Twitter-like social feed built with **ASP.NET Core** and **Blazor**.  
Users can create short posts (up to 250 characters) and view them in a shared feed.

## Purpose
Built as a self-learning project to practice **Entity Framework Core, API design, and Blazor**  
before these topics were introduced in the university curriculum.

## Status
MVP complete – API and Blazor UI with persistent database.  
No longer under active development, but kept as a portfolio project.

## Tech Stack
- C# / .NET 8  
- ASP.NET Core Web API (`Squiglo.API`)  
- Blazor Server (`Squiglo.Client`)  
- Shared Models and DTOs (`Squiglo.Shared`)  
- Entity Framework Core + SQLite
